This folder contains the raw and the preprocessed data files that are required for the visualizations:
 * The [organ_tables](./organ_tables) folder contains the raw data of the organs in JSON format
 * The `human_atlas` is a JSON file which contains the nodes and edges for the visualization of the human atlas (all the organs are included)
 * The `human_atlas_f` contains data for the visualization for the female organs
 * The `human_atlas_m` contains data for the visualization for the male organs
 * The files that end with `_c` are the "corected versions": lung vasculature is connected to "Respiratory System" and the "wall of uterine tube" is removed from the first layer
